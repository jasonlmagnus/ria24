1,"Sex, Gender, Gender Expression","How do employees perceive bias in hiring practices, particularly in relation to gender, race, or age?","The survey does not provide specific measures reported regarding perceptions of bias in hiring practices related to gender, race, or age. However, I can provide insights based on the available data regarding commitment to Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DE&I), which can imply attitudes toward bias in hiring.

Here are some relevant findings:

- Overall, X% of respondents express a strong commitment to DE&I initiatives within their organizations.
- Among different demographic segments, there are variations in the perception of DE&I effectiveness, with X% of respondents feeling that their organization is making significant strides in promoting diversity.

While we have information on DE&I commitment levels, the specific perceptions of bias in hiring practices based on gender, race, or age are not available in this survey. If you need further information or a different analysis, please let me know."
